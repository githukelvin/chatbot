The code selects various elements from the HTML document's DOM using query selectors to interact with the chatbot interface.

The dispMessage function is responsible for displaying messages in the chat interface. It creates list items (li) based on the message type (incoming or outgoing) and appends them to an unordered list (ul) in the chat interface.

The fetchData function is used to fetch data from a chatbot API or service. It makes a POST request to a translation API endpoint, translates the user's message from the source language to the target language, and displays the translated response in the chat interface.

The sendMessage function is triggered when the user clicks the send button. It retrieves the user's input message, checks if it is empty, and displays it as an outgoing message in the chat interface. It then calls the fetchData function to fetch and display the chatbot's response.

The code includes an event listener that adjusts the height of the input field based on user input, allowing for a better user experience when typing longer messages.

The code also includes event listeners for opening, closing, and minimizing the chatbot interface, providing user-friendly options for interacting with the chatbot.

Overall, the code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional chatbot interface that allows users to send messages, receive translated responses from a chatbot API or service, and interact with the chatbot in real-time.
